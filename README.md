# Ancient Coin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ancient-Coin/Ancient-Coin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ancient-Coin/Ancient-Coin)

Ancient Coin (codename ANC) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height 501,000, at roughly December 12, 2017. UTC

At the predetermined block height, Ancient Coin miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.

## WARNING

Ancient Coin is a work in progress. However, you're more than welcome to help test the code and join the development.
